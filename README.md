### Envato Tuts+ Course: Creating Animated HTML5 Page Transitions
#### Instructor: [Craig Campbell](https://tutsplus.com/authors/craig-campbell)

Animation in modern websites is usually limited to hover effects, banner sliders, and the like. Very rarely do we see websites that transition from one page to the next, like you might see in a mobile app. In this course, I will demonstrate how to build animated page transitions for the web using HTML5, CSS transitions, and jQuery.
